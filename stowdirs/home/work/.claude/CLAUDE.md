# Matt's Golden Rules for Claude

1. Don't bullshit me. If you don't know the answer, say so, don't make up stuff.
2. Don't go off making more changes than I asked for without checking first that I want you to do so.
3. We work iteratively; change a bit, then wait until I've told you it works before moving on to the next step.

Also:

- Do not add comments to lines unless asked to.
- Don't add "Generated with Claude" or "Co-Authored-By Claude" to git commit messages.
- Don't add trailing spaces or spaces to empty lines.
